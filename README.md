# Programming and Scripting Project

## About This Repository
This repository contains my submission for the Programming and Scripting Project. This repository is an anlysis of the classic [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

My analysis aims to demonstrate some key programming, scripting and data analytics techniques such as researching and importing a dataset, examining its variables and plotting them in a variety of ways.

## About the Iris Dataset
The Iris Dataset is taken from Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*. It outlines the physical attributes of 150 flowers, comprised of three related Iris species (50 instances of each).

The three speces of Iris studied in Fisher's dataset are:

- Iris Setosa 
- Iris Virginica
- Iris Versicolor

These species are broken down by the following attributes:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)
- Species

All of the Iris's were picked in the Gaspé Peninsula (near Quebec City, Canada) on the same day.

# What Makes this Dataset so Special?
Aside from being published by an already established and successful statistician, this dataset is renowned across multiple scientific and computing fields in it's own right for a number of reasons:

the dataset is easily accessible for beginners; it has an easily recognizable and contextualised subject matter (flowers) and, in examining those flowers, contains relatively few variables.

Further, the data is evenly spread amongst three species (50 flowers of each), with no missing data to tidy.

Although the dats is straight forward, scientists and data analysists can use it to test and utilise a wide range of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

80+ years later we're still using the Iris dataset to play around with statistics, machine learning and data analysis, now it's just a few clicks away from anyone with internet access.


## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and create this project and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.
