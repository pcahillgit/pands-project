## About This Repository
This repository contains my submission for the Programming and Scripting Project. This repository is an anlysis of the classic [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

My analysis aims to demonstrate some key programming, scripting and data analytics techniques such as researching and importing a dataset, examining its variables and plotting them in a variety of ways.

## About the Iris Dataset
The Iris Dataset is taken from Ronald Fisher's 1936 paper *The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems*. The study is an example of taxonomy, or the classification of living things. In the paper, Fisher outlines the physical attributes of 150 flowers, comprised of three related Iris species (fifty instances of each).

The three speces of Iris studied in Fisher's dataset are:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Virginica
- Iris Versicolor

These species are broken down by the following attributes:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

All of the Irises were picked in the Gaspé Peninsula (near Quebec City, Canada) under the same conditions (on the same day, by the same person).

## What Makes This Particular Dataset so Special?
Aside from being published by an already established and successful (albeit controversial) statistician, this dataset is renowned across multiple scientific and computing fields in it's own right for a number of reasons, explaining why it's still in use 80+ years after those 150 flowers were plucked.

The Iris dataset is easily accessible for beginners; it has an easily contextualised subject matter (flowers) and examines those flowers in relatively few variables, using the same unit of meaurement for each (centimetres). Further, the data is evenly spread amongst three species (fifty instances of each), with no missing data- this means it doesn't require tidying before analysis and each of the three species of flower can be compared to one another using the same count of instances.

Although the dats is straight forward, scientists and data analysists can use it to test and utilise a wide range of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. Judging from a quick review of the literature surounding the dataset, this analysis can range from those dipping their toes into coding, statistics and data analysis to those blazing the trail.

## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and create this project and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.

My repository is structured as follows:

- This README which provides information on the Iris dataset and lists the references.
- The iris.data file which contains the raw Iris data, this is imported in my code.
- The analysis.py file which contains code used to analyse the dataset.
- All other files are products of that analysis; summaries of the variables and plots.
