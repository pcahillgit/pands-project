# Programming and Scripting Project

## About This Repository
This repository contains my submission for the Programming and Scripting Project. This repository is an anlysis of the classic [Iris Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

## About the Iris Dataset

## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and create this project and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.
